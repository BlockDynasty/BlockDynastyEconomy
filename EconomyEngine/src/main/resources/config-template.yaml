#The plugin is designed to work in both offline and online modes.
#Therefore:
#In online mode: the user will be validated with their UUID, and if a change in nickname is detected, it will be updated in the database.
#In offline mode: the user will be validated with their nickname, and if a change in UUID is detected, it will be updated in the database.
#As you can see, selecting this option from the beginning is critical and must be synchronized with your network, since
#changing the operating mode from offline to online during the process will result in the total loss of information.
#It is impossible to assume that the UUIDs uploaded in offline mode are true, as they may be random data not supported by Mojang.
#-> Make your decision carefully and set the same value on all your servers. Thank you.
